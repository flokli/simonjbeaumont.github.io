Just found out today that the work I did over the summer for _Akai Professional_ and _Numark Industries_ is actually being put to good useâ€”shock horror!

Built a new (supposedly) extensible and flexible production test framework and... it's now being used on their new flagship product: the [_MPC Renaissance_](http://www.akaiprompc.com/mpc-renaissance)!

Hope they like it enough to use it on their next big-seller too!
