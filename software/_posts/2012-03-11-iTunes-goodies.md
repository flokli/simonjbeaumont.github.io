1. _Invert Store links:_ Ever been frustrated when in a playlist and you want to go the artist for a particular song.

2. _Find using `⌘F`:_ It annoyed me for a while that I couldn't use the `⌘F` keyboard shortcut to place focus in the library search box. Well this one's solved too...

3. _Track names in Dock:_ This one basically shows the track name on iTunes' dock icon when a new track starts which is (arguably not) a nice to have.
