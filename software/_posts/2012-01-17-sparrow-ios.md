title: Sparrow for iPhone... it's coming

Apparently Sparrow are well on the way to offering their alternative to the much-loved(?) native iOS mail client. [See for yourself...](http://sprw.me/comingsoon/)

In the recent months [Sparrow for Mac](http://sparrowmailapp.com) has become my email client of choice. It's a great example of an application written with the user in mind: it has a lovely UX; (almost) full Gmail functionality; and spurts regular update goodies.

Following this [teaser](http://tumblr.com/Z8NiNyBSB8yJ) on their blog I started to wonder: do we really need Sparrow for iPhone? My personal conclusions is that there is a gap for Sparrow to fill on the iOS devices! There are a _small_ set of niggles I have with the way I can hook up Apple's native Mail app with my Gmail account. I've currently got my iPhone hooked up to Gmail as an Exchange server account on my device via GoogleSync and I know some of the below can be solved using other methods but I have yet to find something that does _everything_ well. It's also worth noting that I haven't tried iCloud and don't really intend to ;)

1.  Support two-way synchronisation of _sent_ mail. That is, if I send a mail on my iPhone it does not appear in my other clients.
2.  Proper deletion of mail. Moving an item to trash on the iPhone will archive it in Gmail. I know that this is configurable with the IMAP version but there are plenty of reasons why not to go down that route. Also it would be nice to have the option each time; something that the Sparrow Mac app has done nicely.
3.  Seamless multiple email addresses. It would be nice to be able to add one Gmail account to my iPhone and still be able to send mail from the other outgoing addresses it might use
4.  Assuming that 3 is implemented then multiple signatures.

Simply, if Sparrow can plug all these holes in their mobile client it will certainly win my vote.
