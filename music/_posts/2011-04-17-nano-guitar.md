title: "The Nano Guitar: A guitar as small as a blood cell"
---
About the size of a single blood cell and inaudible to the human ear, is there any point in the nano guitar? Yes – it's really cool! (There's a read more link at the bottom for those who want details)

## What is it?
The world's smallest ever music instrument. A miniature guitar made out of
crystalline silicon, 10 <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micron">microns</a> long (about the size of
a human red blood cell), with six strings that are each about 100 atoms
wide.

## How does it work?
Though the<a href="http://www.lutherie.net/nano_gtr.html"> first nano
guitar </a>was created in 1997 at Cornell University, it wasn't until a<a
href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2003-11/cuns-np111803.php"> second
model</a> was crafted in 2003 that the instrument was actually "played". No,
they didn't make the world's tiniest plectrum and <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innerspace">shrink Dennis Quaid</a> down to
subatomic size to strum the dainty axe. Because they're so incredibly teeny,
the strings could only be sounded by targeting them with miniature lasers in an
atomic force microscope. This resulted in the world's smallest ever kerrang! A
40 megahertz signal that is 130,000 times higher than the sound of a full-scale
guitar – and reportedly one of the highest-pitched tones recorded.

## Where does it come from? 
ornell researcher Dustin W Carr created the nano guitar under the direction of
Professor Harold G Craighead. The project was intended to be a fun,
media-friendly way of advertising<a title="More from guardian.co.uk on
Nanotechnology"

Though there is neither great musical potential or demand for a tiny, silicon
guitar that is inaudible to the human ear, the point was to illustrate how
incredibly precise and detailed nanotechnology – the science of making
molecular-proportioned, functional electromechanical devices – had become. Dr
Craighead and his team went on to create even smaller machines – such as
nanoscales that can measure the weight of individual bacteria, recording data
and diagnosing medical conditions at an atomic level.

## Why is it classic?
It's just an extremely cool idea. Nanotechnology is often spoken about in
cryptic, fearful, science-fiction terms, and it's true that the technology has
been used to create surveillance cameras and listening devices smaller than a
grain of sand, but the nano guitar is a pure, lighthearted symbol of scientific
optimism.

## Five facts and things
* As the nano guitar is outside the range of even the most sensitive
microphone, the acoustic trace of the sound is measured by a computer
calculating the reflections of the laser light used to "strum" the strings.

* One of the discoveries that came directly out of the nano guitar was the
realisation that using electric-driven nanostructures to individually modulate
the intensity of tiny laser beams could be useful in fibre optic
communications.

* If the nano guitar played the highest-pitched note in the universe, what is
the lowest? In 2003, x-ray telescopes monitored a <a
href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/universe/black_hole_sound.html">black
hole in the Perseus galaxy</a> belching out tones that were 57 octaves below
human hearing – supposedly the deepest note ever detected.

* Still having trouble getting your head around the dimensions of the nano
guitar? A nanometre is one-billionth of a metre. A human hair is about 200,000
nanometres in diameter. The nano guitar is just 10,000 nanometres long –
one-twentieth the diameter of one of your hairs.

* Though the 1997 nano guitar was originally said to be modelled on a Fender
Stratocaster, to our expert eyes it seems to more closely resemble the<a
